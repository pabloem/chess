    <p>Chess is awesome. I grew up playing it with my brother, my mother, and later on with friends and coworkers.
    I never became good; but I did enjoy it a lot.</p>
    <a name="captures"></a>
    <h3>Who captures who?</h3>
    <h4>Who captures you...</h4>
    <p>Here you can see in what proportion a piece is captured by other pieces. You can click on the pieces on the 
    left, and a chart will be drawn showing you how often the pieces on the left are captured by the pieces on the
    right.</p>
    <p>For instance, a pawn that has been
    captured, has a 47% chance of having been captured by another pawn - whereas a rook has only a 7% chance of
    having been captured by a pawn.</p>
    <div class="visualization content is-center">
      <iframe src="./capture_proportions.html" width="500" height="370" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
    </div>
    <h4>Who do you capture...</h4>
    <p>The following graph is an inverse of the previous one. It represents how often one piece captures a piece
    of a different kind.</p>
    <p>For example, 73% of the pieces that pawns capture are other pawns, and only 2% are queens.</p>
    <div class="visualization content is-center">
      <iframe src="./capture_proportions.html?inverse" width="500" height="370" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <a name="pawn_captures"></a>
    <h4>The Path to Crowning</h4>
    <p>We saw from Oliver Brennan's <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2014/10/30/chess-piece-survival-rates/">Chess 
    piece survival rates</a> how probable is that a chess piece will survive or be captured. Here, 
    I observe where pawns are most likely to have been captured. As we see, most are captured in the center of the
    board. Note that 0% at the end of the board - this is because pawns are crowned there - This visualization does not show
    whether the resulting crowned piece survives its first turn.</p>
    <div class="visualization content is-center">
      <iframe src="./pawn_captures.html" width="500" height="280" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
    </div>
    <p> It is interesting that Black pawns tend to be captured earlier on their path to crowning, as opposed to
    white pawns that generally bite the big one further along the road.</p>
    <p>Of course, pawns don't always die the same way on each square. For instance, both white and black pawns die
    the most on their second squares (square 4 and 5). Of this 37%, <b>0.4% for white and 1% for black</b> are captures <b>en-passant!</b></p>

                <p>
                  The Korean language is very rich, and its vocabulary is hard to learn. The Hanja Explorer
                  is an innovative tool that helps you study Korean vocabulary by <b>visualizing</b>
                  the meaning and the similarities of different words.
                </p>

                    What is Hanja?
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Korean language has evolved over time; borrowing words from different languages. Hanja
                  means 'chinese character', and about 70% of Korean vocabulary uses Hanja in some form. Something
                  that's great about Hanja is that they can be mixed and matched to create new words.
                </p>

                    Why study Hanja?
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Traditional education of Korean as a foreign language has largely ignored the role of Hanja
                  in the study of Korean vocabulary. On the other hand, materials that are specific for the
                  study of hanja place too high a value in learning how to write a character, making the process
                  slow and difficult. These practices are not useful, nor practical.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Here, you'll learn what are the <b>building blocks</b> of words; and you will be able to
                  use them when writing and reading Korean right away.

              These visualizations were assembled by <a class=".ribbon-link" href="http://iampablo.me">Pablo Estrada</a>. 
              I got this idea after reading a post of common piece moves in Reddit's /r/dataisbeautiful. I downloaded the
              dataset, and got to work.

            <p>
              The layouts and styling of the website are based on Yahoo's <a href="http://purecss.io">Pure</a>. It's a
              wonderful framework for pure CSS styling of websites. It's my first front end framework, and I'm quite
              fond of it.
