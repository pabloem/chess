    <p>Chess is awesome. I grew up playing it with my brother, my mother, and later on with friends and coworkers.
    I never became good; but I did enjoy it a lot. I was inspired to make these visualizations after I saw other
    awesome visualizations that used the Millionbase (a dataset with 2.2million chess games from 1996 to 2013).</p>
    <p> These visualizations are about piece captures. The first two are about which pieces capture and are captured
    by which other pieces. The next one shows where pieces are most often captured.</p>
    <a name="captures"></a>
    <h3>Who captures who?</h3>
    <h4>Who captures you...</h4>
    <p>Here you can see in what proportion a piece is captured by other pieces. You can click on the pieces on the 
    left, and a chart will be drawn showing you how often the pieces on the left are captured by the pieces on the
    right.</p>
    <p>For instance, a pawn that has been
    captured, has a 47% chance of having been captured by another pawn - whereas a rook has only a 7% chance of
    having been captured by a pawn.</p>

      <iframe src="./capture_proportions.html" width="500" height="370" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
    </div>
    <h4>Who do you capture...</h4>
    <p>The following graph is an inverse of the previous one. It represents how often one piece captures a piece
    of a different kind.</p>
    <p>For example, 73% of the pieces that pawns capture are other pawns, and only 2% are queens.</p>

    <h3>The Battlefield</h3>
    <p>We saw from Oliver Brennan's <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2014/10/30/chess-piece-survival-rates/">Chess 
    piece survival rates</a> how probable is that a chess piece will survive or be captured. He inspired me to look into
    where chess pieces are most likely to be captured.</p>
    <p>The following visualization shows extensively the patterns
    in which pieces are captured. You can customize the visualization by selecting the kind of piece, the color of it,
    and whether to separate by columns, rows, or squares..</p>
    <div class="visualization content is-center">
      <iframe src="./full_captures.html" width="750" height="550" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
    </div>
    <p> Maybe it is expected that most of the captures occur in the center of the board; but if we look at individual
    pieces, and their state, we might find more interesting patterns. For instance, unlike most pieces, Rooks are 
    captured most often at the edges of the board.</p>
    <p>By looking around, you'll find that a lot of the concentration around the center comes from the fact that 
    there's 8 pawns, and at most 2 of every other piece (not counting crowned pieces). Most pieces are captured in the center,
    but they are more distributed than pawns.</p>
