    <p>Chess is awesome. I grew up playing it with my brother, my mother, and later on with friends and coworkers.
    I never became good; but I did enjoy it a lot.</p>
    <a name="capture"></a>
    <h4>Who captures who?</h4>
    <p>Here you can see in what proportion a piece is captured by other pieces. You can click on the pieces on the 
    left, and a chart will be drawn showing you how often the pieces on the left are captured by the pieces on the
    right.</p>
    <p>For instance, a pawn that has been
    captured, has a 47% chance of having been captured by another pawn - whereas a rook has only a 7% chance of
    having been captured by a pawn.</p>

    <h4>The Capture Graph (a.k.a. the Food Chain)</h4>
    <p>
      Using the proportions from the <b>Who captures who</b> chart, we can build a network of captures.
      This network can represent many things.

                <p>
                  The Korean language is very rich, and its vocabulary is hard to learn. The Hanja Explorer
                  is an innovative tool that helps you study Korean vocabulary by <b>visualizing</b>
                  the meaning and the similarities of different words.
                </p>

                    What is Hanja?
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Korean language has evolved over time; borrowing words from different languages. Hanja
                  means 'chinese character', and about 70% of Korean vocabulary uses Hanja in some form. Something
                  that's great about Hanja is that they can be mixed and matched to create new words.

                    Why study Hanja?
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Traditional education of Korean as a foreign language has largely ignored the role of Hanja
                  in the study of Korean vocabulary. On the other hand, materials that are specific for the
                  study of hanja place too high a value in learning how to write a character, making the process
                  slow and difficult. These practices are not useful, nor practical.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Here, you'll learn what are the <b>building blocks</b> of words; and you will be able to
                  use them when writing and reading Korean right away.

              These visualizations were assembled by <a class=".ribbon-link" href="http://iampablo.me">Pablo Estrada</a>. 
              I got this idea after reading a post of common piece moves in Reddit's /r/dataisbeautiful. I downloaded the
              dataset, and got to work.
            </p>
            <p>
              The layouts and styling of the website are based on Yahoo's <a href="http://purecss.io">Pure</a>. It's a
              wonderful framework for pure CSS styling of websites. It's my first front end framework, and I'm quite
              fond of it.
